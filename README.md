# SAR Image Super-Resolution using Deep Residual Learning

### Project Overview
This project implements a Deep Learning pipeline to enhance the spatial resolution of **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)** imagery. SAR data is notoriously difficult to process due to speckle noise and complex geometry. This project utilizes a **Very Deep Super Resolution (VDSR)** inspired architecture with custom **Residual Blocks** to reconstruct high-frequency spatial details from low-resolution inputs. The data is sourced from the Capella Space Open Data catalog (IEEE Data Contest collection) and retrieved dynamically via the STAC API.

### Technical Highlights
* **Custom Architecture:** A 10-layer Deep Residual Network featuring **Feature Scaling** (factor of 0.1) within residual blocks to stabilize deep gradient flow.
* **SAR-Physics Optimized Loss:** Replaced standard MSE with a weighted combination of **L1 Loss** (for sharp edges) and **SSIM (Structural Similarity)** to preserve the physical geometry of radar returns.
* **Dense Data Engineering:** Implemented high-density patch extraction with a 50% overlap (stride 32) to quadruple the training dataset while maintaining data integrity.
* **Fully Convolutional Inference:** The model supports **Full-Scene Inference**, allowing it to process entire SAR geographic expanses of any size natively without tiling artifacts.
