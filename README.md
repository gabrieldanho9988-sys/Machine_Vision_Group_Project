## Machine Vision Project – AI & Automation

## Project Overview
This project was developed as a **group examination task** as part of the Master’s program in **AI & Automation**.

The goal was to design and implement a **machine vision pipeline** for object recognition based on image data.

---

## Problem Statement
The task focuses on collecting raw image data, preprocessing it, and training a machine learning model to classify visual objects reliably.

---

## Methodology
The project was implemented in the following phases:

1. Data collection using a webcam
2. Automated image labeling
3. Image preprocessing
4. Feature extraction
5. Model training and evaluation

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow

---

## Results
The final model achieved satisfactory classification performance on the test dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of the full pipeline.

---

## Team Contribution
This was a **group project**.
